These files are copied from the original Solr droplets set up by Taufik and Lu Min.
They are poorly maintained and incomplete.

If we want to keep providing this transformation, we need to spend some effort on properly mapping all of the available
fields and their content into the csv transformer.

Note: 
The XML transformers are not used, as they worked with hardcoded XML Strings.
If a user is looking for the activity XML, they can use the source data file.
